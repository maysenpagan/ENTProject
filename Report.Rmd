#   The abstract serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications. Authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they are submitting to for word limits and if structural elements like subheadings, citations, or equations are permitted.

  **Purpose**: The abstract serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications. The abstract must not include subheadings (unless expressly permitted in the journal's Instructions to Authors), equations or citations. As a guide the abstract should not exceed 200 words. Most journals do not set a hard limit however authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they are submitting to.

The abstract must not include subheadings (unless expressly permitted in the journal's Instructions to Authors), equations or citations. As a guide the abstract should not exceed 200 words. Most journals do not set a hard limit however authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they are submitting to.
