# A Predictive Modeling of Tracheostomy Readmissions

Hospital readmissions following the completion of a procedure poses significant challenges for both patients and hospitals. Being readmitted could increase the risk of complications for patients and introduce states of distress. For hospitals, readmissions present a strain on resources and their reputation. This project aims to develop a model that can predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of being discharged. For those patients who are readmitted within 30 days, this project also analyzes the number of days until they will be readmitted as well as the most common diagnoses that the patients will be readmitted with.

The final report can be found in files beginning with "Report." Figures from the report are located in the "figures" folder and the R code for this project's analysis can be found in the "code" folder.

Maysen Pagan, Febriany Lete, and Aabha Laktar worked on the report with more detailed contributions at the end of the report. Maysen Pagan worked on the comoridity code, Febriany Lete worked on the predictive modeling code, and Aabha Latkar worked on the exploratory data analysis code.
